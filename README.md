# Neighbourhood Map

Project 8 Front End Nanodegree Udacity

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Project Overview

To build a one-page application using REACT.  The app will show a google map with map markers to identify at least 5 locations around the neighbourhood you base it on.  I based mine on my hometown of Saltburn By The Sea because it's a beautiful and quirky place.

The user of the app will be able to view a set of locations that provide information, images, links etc about that location.

The app must be responsive and be accessible.  The use of a service worker to allow for offline usage.
