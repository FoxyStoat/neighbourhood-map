## Project Overview

To build a one-page application using REACT.  The app will show a google map with map markers to identify at least 5 locations around the neighbourhood you base it on.  I based mine on my hometown of Saltburn By The Sea because it's a beautiful and quirky place.

The user of the app will be able to view a set of locations that provide information, images, links etc about that location.
